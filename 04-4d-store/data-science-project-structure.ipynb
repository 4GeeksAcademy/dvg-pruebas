This is a pretty tedious and repetitive task. Not to mention that it’s prone to errors. That is why we want to introduce to you an awesome tool: Cookiecutter!"

    "\n",
    "Projects can be python packages, web applications, machine learning apps with complex workflows or anything you can think of\n",
    "Templates are what cookiecutter uses to create projects. What cookiecutter does is quite simple: it clones a directory and put it inside your new project. It then replaces all the names that are between {{ and }} (Jinja2 syntax) with names that it finds in the cookiecutter.json file. The best part is that it also has a specific template for data science and machine learning projects. (We’ll see an example of how to build a cookiecutter template)\n",
