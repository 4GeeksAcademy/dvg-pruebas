    "We have seen how to work with cookicutter on a common streamlit project. But Cookiecutter has a lot of templates for different project types, so as you can imagine, Data Science is not the exception.\n",

    "Use the Cookiecutter Data Science open-source template to kickstart data science projects that follow the best standards in the industry.\n",

    "```py\n",
    "cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science\n",

    "5. In the .gitignore file write data/ to include the data folder so we avoid uploading the big datasets every time we commit to Github.\n",
