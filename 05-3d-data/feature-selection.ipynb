    "- Filter Methods - feature selection is done independent of the learning algorithm, before any modelling is done. One example is finding the correlation between every feature and the target and throwing out those that don't meet a threshold. Easy, fast, but naive and not as performant as other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wrapper Methods - train models on subsets of the features and use the subset that results in the best performance. Examples are Stepwise or Recursive feature selection. Advantages are that it considers each feature in the context of the other features, but can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Embedded Methods - learning algorithms have built-in feature selection. For example: L1 regularization."
