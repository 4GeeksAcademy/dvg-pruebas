    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees belong to a class of supervised machine learning algorithms, which are used in both classification (predicts discrete outcome) and regression (predicts continuous numeric outcomes) predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are decision trees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a sequence of conditions that allow us to split the data iteratively (a node after another, essentially) until we can assign each data into a label. New data will simply follow the decision tree and end up in the most suitable category.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for classification, regression, to measure feature importance and for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let´s see a simple a simple decision tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![decision-tree](../assets/decision-tree.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The leaves that contain a mixture of people who have and don’t have Heart Disease are called impure. We can quantify impurity using Gini Impurity, Entropy, and Information Gain. The higher the Gini Impurity, the more impure the leaves are. So we want the value to be as low as possible. We calculate the Gini Impurity of each of the leaves first, then calculate the total Gini Impurity of the split. The formula to calculate Gini Impurity of leaves is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini impurity of a leaf: 1 - (probability of 'yes')^2 - (probability of 'no')^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding Gini Impurity for continuous variables is a little more involved. First, we need to sort the column from lowest to highest, then calculate the average for adjacent rows. These average values will be our candidates for root node thresholds. Lastly, we calculate the Gini Impurity values for each average value. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Between several features, how do we know which feature should be the root node?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini impurity is calculated for all root node candidates, the one with the lowest Gini Impurity is going to be our root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "We add branches to nodes that are impure to reduce impurity. Adding branches pretty much follows the same process as finding the root node. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the main hyperparameters that you can tune for decision trees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, decision trees have the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- max depth - maximum tree depth\n",
    "\n",
    "- min samples split - minimum number of samples for a node to be split\n",
    "\n",
    "- min samples leaf - minimum number of samples for each leaf node\n",
    "\n",
    "- max leaf nodes - the maximum number of leaf nodes in the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- max features - maximum number of features that are evaluated for splitting at each node (only valid for algorithms that randomize features considered at each split)\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional decision tree is greedy and looks at all features at each split point, but many modern implementations allow splitting on randomized features (as seen in scikit learn) so max features may or may not be a tuneable hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How each hyperparameter affects the model's ability to learn?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- max depth: increasing max depth will decrease bias and increase variance \n",
    "\n",
    "- min samples split: increasing min samples split increases bias and decreases variance\n",
    "\n",
    "- min samples leaf: increasing min samples leaf increases bias and decreases variance\n",
    "\n",
    "- max leaf nodes: decreasing max leaf node increases bias and decreases variance\n",
    "\n",
    "- max features: decreasing maximum features increases bias and decreases variance\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be instances when changing hyperparameters has no effect on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What metrics are usually used to compute splits?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini impurity or entropy. Both generally produce similar results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Gini impurity?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gini impurity is a measurement of how often a randomly chosen record would be incorrectly classified if it was randomly classified using the distribution of the set of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A low Gini (near 0) means most records from the sample are in the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high Gini (maximum of 1 or less, depending on number of classes) = records from sample are spread evenly across classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is entropy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy is the measure of the purity of members among non-empty classes. It is very similar to Gini in concept, but a slightly different calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low entropy (near 0) means most records from the sample are in the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "High entropy (maximum of 1) means records from sample are spread evenly across classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are decision trees parametric or non-parametric models?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-parametric. The number of model parameters is not determined before creating the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are some ways to reduce overfitting with decision trees?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce maximum depth\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase min samples split\n",
    "\n",
    "- Balance data to prevent bias toward dominant classes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase the number of samples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decrease the number of features\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is feature importance evaluated in decision-tree based models?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The features that are split on most frequently and are closest to the top of the tree, thus affecting the largest number of samples, are considered to be the most important."
