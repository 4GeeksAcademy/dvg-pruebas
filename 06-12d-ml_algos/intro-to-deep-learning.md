# Intro to Deep Learning

Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning dealing with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Deep learning algorithms are similar to how nervous system structured where each neuron connected each other and passing information.

Deep learning models tend to perform well with amount of data wheras old machine learning models stop improving after a saturation point. One of differences between machine learning and deep learning model is on the feature extraction area. Feature extraction is done by human in machine learning whereas deep learning model figure out by itself.
