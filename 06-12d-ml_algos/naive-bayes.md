# Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes is an algorithm that is simple enough to be completed by hand. However, this algorithm really makes you understand a big deal about classification. It is probably one of the most useful algorithms for simple Machine Learning use cases.

**How does Naive Bayes work?**

The algorithm avoids considering each individual sample in the dataset, like every other machine learning algorithm. Instead, we only need to input the mean, standard deviation, and alfa for the feature belonging to each class. Most of the data is lost in the process because is not even considered. However, if all features are normally distributed, this algorithm can be extremely accurate.

This algorithm NECESSARILY needs you to understand the importance of using distributions in data science. Knowing the best way to model your data, for example, if it belongs to a lognormal distribution or a normal distribution, really makes a difference when building models.
