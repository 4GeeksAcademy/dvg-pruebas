## Week 12: Real life cases

1.   *Look for a statistics case that can be solved in paper (finish the solution) and scale it to coding big amounts of data
        --->  can be the rats problem but reshaped.*
2.   *Look for an image classification good case-----> can be a case applied to medicine (xrays, etc)*
3.   *Look for an NLP, neural networks or recommender system(clustering) good case*-----> Look for the new Spotify case in Kaggle competitions.
