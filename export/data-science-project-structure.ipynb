    "The first tool we want to introduce in this lesson is Anaconda. Anaconda is an amazing collection of scientific Python packages, tools, resources, and IDEs. This package includes many important tools that a Data Scientist can use to harness the incredible force of Python. Anaconda individual edition is free and open source. It runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Anaconda is great for deep models and neural networks. You can build models, deploy them, and integrate with leading technologies in the subject. Anaconda is optimized to run efficiently for machine learning tasks and will save you time when developing great algorithms. Anaconda contains Conda and Anaconda Navigator, an intuitive platform, where you can create, load, and switch between environments very easily. You will also be able to search and install open-source data science and machine learning packages, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, as well as Jupyter Notebooks and VS Code. You will be able to run the Anaconda Prompt terminal or the Anaconda Powershell terminal with your current environment. \n",
