# Intro to Deep Learning

Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning dealing with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. Deep learning algorithms are similar to how nervous system structured where each neuron connected each other and passing information.

Deep learning models tend to perform well with amount of data wheras old machine learning models stop improving after a saturation point. One of differences between machine learning and deep learning model is on the feature extraction area. Feature extraction is done by human in machine learning whereas deep learning model figure out by itself.

**What are activation functions?**

Let's imagine an example about a model that decides if a student is accepted to a university based on 

**What are weights?**

When input data comes into a neuron, it gets multiplied by a weight value that is assigned to this particular input. These weights start out as random values, and as the neural network learns more about what kind of input data leads to a student being accepted into a university, the network adjusts the weights based on any errors in categorization that the previous weights resulted in. This is called training the neural network.

Weights and biases are the learnable parameters. In the following equation: $y = mx+b$ 'm' (the slope) would be the weight and 'b' would represent bias.
