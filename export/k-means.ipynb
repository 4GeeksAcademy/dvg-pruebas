    "\n",
    "K-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions observations into k clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cluster means are usually randomized at the start (often by choosing random observations from the data) and then updated as more records are observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iterations, a new observation is assigned to a cluster based on which cluster mean it is nearest and then the means are recalculated, or updated , with the new observation information included.\n",

    "\n",
    "Customer segmentation is probably the most common use case for k-means clustering (although it has many uses)"
