# K-means

K-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that partitions observations into k clusters. 

The cluster means are usually randomized at the start (often by choosing random observations from the data) and then updated as more records are observed.

At each iterations, a new observation is assigned to a cluster based on which cluster mean it is nearest and then the means are recalculated, or updated , with the new observation information included.

**What is one common use case for k-mean clustering?**

Customer segmentation is probably the most common use case for k-means clustering (although it has many uses)
