# Standard Normal Table

The entries in this table provide the numerical values of (z) = P(Z <= z), where Z is a standard normal random variable, for z between 0 and 3.49.For example, to find (1.71) we look at the row corresponding to 1.7 and the column corresponding to 0.01 so that (1.71) = .9564. When z is negative, the value of (z) can be found using the formula (z) = 1 -  (-z).
